Hey guys my name is Billy Phan, a student studying in computer science based in Philadelphia, PA. I chose to study computer science, because growing up, I was always fascinated with technology and being around it made me fall in love with it. I aspire to change the landscape of technology in the future with my skills I am learning.

Outside of school, I enjoy hobbies, such as video games, basketball, gym, art, and nature!
